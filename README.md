# Object-Detection
Object Detection for Traffic Analysis on  Polish Roads 
Objective: The objective of this project is to develop and train machine learning models for object detection in traffic scenes using a dataset of images from Polish roads. The project focuses on detecting various road elements such as vehicles, traffic signs, pedestrians, and traffic lights, aiming to improve applications in traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and road safety analysis. 

Dataset Description: The dataset contains 12,000 images of Polish roads, including both highways and city streets, captured through a car camera in Krak√≥w, Poland. The dataset covers a variety of road conditions (day and night) and includes manually labeled objects for 11 different classes: 

Car: Vehicles without trailers. 

Different-Traffic-Sign: Information and order signs, excluding warning and prohibition signs. 

Green-Traffic-Light: Traffic lights for cars only. 

Motorcycle: Motorcycles in the traffic scene. 

Pedestrian: People and cyclists on the road. 

Pedestrian-Crossing: Marked pedestrian crossings. 

Prohibition-Sign: Traffic prohibition signs. 

Red-Traffic-Light: Red traffic lights for cars. 

Speed-Limit-Sign: Signs indicating speed limits. 

Truck: Vehicles with trailers. 

Warning-Sign: Signs warning of road hazards or changes. 

The dataset was annotated using the YOLO format, with 2,000 images manually labeled and an additional 9,000 generated through data augmentation techniques such as crop, saturation, brightness, and exposure adjustments. The data provides a rich variety of traffic scenarios and conditions, ideal for object detection tasks. 

Potential Applications: 

Autonomous Driving: The object detection model can be integrated into self-driving systems to detect and respond to road elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real-time. 

Traffic Monitoring: The model can be used for real-time monitoring and analysis of road traffic, assisting authorities in managing traffic flow, detecting violations, and improving road safety. 

Driver Assistance Systems: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can use this model to alert drivers to potential hazards, such as pedestrians or red lights, improving road safety. 

Smart City Infrastructure: Traffic analysis systems in smart cities can leverage this model to optimize traffic management, identify areas of congestion, and plan future road infrastructure development. 

Road Safety Analysis: The model can be used to analyze how different objects and road conditions affect traffic accidents or violations, helping improve road safety policies. 

Methodology: The project will involve training object detection models using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, given the annotation format. Other deep learning models, such as Faster R-CNN, can be explored for comparison. The data will be preprocessed to handle lighting variations and different image sizes, followed by training and validation of the models. The model performance will be evaluated based on precision, recall, and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. 

Expected Outcomes: 

A high-performance object detection model capable of accurately detecting vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and road signs in various conditions. 

Applications of the model in autonomous driving systems and smart traffic management. 

Insights into the distribution and impact of different traffic elements on road safety and traffic efficiency.
